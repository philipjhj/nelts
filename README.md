# NELTS

This is a python implementation of the NELTS algorithm described in [[1]](#neltspaper).

It attempts to follow the MATLAB implementation kindly provided by the authors [here](http://alumni.cs.ucr.edu/~yhao/NELTS.html). See the [docs](https://nelts.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html) for differences between this version and theirs.

This code has not yet been tested or evaluated on any data set comparable to the ones in the paper.
